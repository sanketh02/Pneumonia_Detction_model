🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning (CNN)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Deep Learning-based web application that detects Pneumonia from Chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model analyzes uploaded X-ray images and predicts whether the patient is:

✅ Normal
⚠ Pneumonia

1. The application is built using:

1.1 TensorFlow / Keras
1.2 OpenCV
1.3 NumPy
1.4 Streamlit (for web interface)

2. Problem Statement

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early.
This project aims to assist in automated medical image classification using deep learning techniques.

3. Model Architecture =>

The CNN model consists of:
Multiple Convolutional Layers
Max Pooling Layers
Flatten Layer
Fully Connected Dense Layers
Softmax / Sigmoid Output Layer
